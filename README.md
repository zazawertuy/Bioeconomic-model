Abstract
This paper analyzes the influence that social networks and the state of a common property resource have
on compliance with social norms and signposts the maximum and minimum levels of influence that different
types of social networks have on cooperation. This allows policymakers to compare the effectiveness of
legal and informal enforcement policies and how the design of these policies is affected by the presence
of social networks. We find that stable steady states exist, where compliers and defectors coexist
(partial cooperation), but their stability requires that the sanctioning costs are bell-shaped. Full
cooperation is another possible equilibrium but is unlikely to prevail if the agents do not perceive the
scarcity of the common property resource as severe. A numerical study that is empirically calibrated for
an aquifer in Spain shows that subsidizing the compliers’ sanctioning costs may impede the attainment of
a steady state based on partial cooperation. Furthermore, depending on the type of network and the
scarcity of the resource, the critical mass of compliers for attaining cooperation can be reduced by at
most 26% by informal policies. Combinations of different informal enforcement policies should be applied
cautiously because efforts to influence public opinion may reduce the effectiveness of policies that aim
to increase the agents’ cohesiveness. If the regulator lacks information about the network structure, an
alternative is to focus policies on areas where the numbers of compliers and defectors are equal.
